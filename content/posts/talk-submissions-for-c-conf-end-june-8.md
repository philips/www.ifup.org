**Update**: Deadline is now the end of June 13th (Wednesday)

"*Everyone uses C to implement interesting things.*" This is the core
idea that drove me to start working on [The C Conference][cconf]. From
operating systems, libraries, games and embedded devices C is at the
core of the tech around us.

Many people have asked, "oh, the C conference, hmm, which one?". This is
a great question. Every year there are conferences to discuss systems
built and used by C devlopers including GCC/LLVM summits, ApacheCon,
Linux Kernel Summit and BSDCONs, to name a few. But, the focus is on
developing the project not what the project is developed with.

The C Conference is for meeting people outside of your own communities,
cross pollinating knowledge between projects, discovering how to solve
similar problems and finding new tools. We have a lot to show each
other.

There is precedence too. Major languges like Python or Javascript have
language conferences. As an example, JQuery is arguably the most
ubiquitous js web framework ever and it has its [own conference][jquery]
but [JSConf][jsconf] is an anchor within the Javascript community for
sharing the breadth of Javascript knowledge.

So, lets give it a go. The C Conference is accepting proposals and talk
ideas through the end of Wednesday (June 13th) on [the reverse CFP][pfc].

It has been a lot of work and fun to reach into communities and projects
to get the talk ideas and proposals that have been posted so far. But,
we haven't yet reached the full audience for this conference. Help
spread the word about [The C Conference][cconf] and [submit a proposal
today][pfc].
