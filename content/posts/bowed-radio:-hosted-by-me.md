I have been a long time listener of the podcast [Bowed Radio][org]. So, when
Mark put out a call for collaboraters I jumped on board and figured out
how I could help. The result is my first ever [podcast episode][bowed].
You can find all the details of the show over there. Enjoy :)

As this is a more or less techinical blog here are the tools I used:

Audacity

I bought [this][gomic] microphone to record my [violin][v] when I practice
and it worked great in recording the podcast too. It sounds suprisingly
good and the stand is nice: it can clip to your laptop screen bezel or
rest on a desk self supported. Overall I am happy with it.

Using those two tools I got over the hurdle of making my first podcast.
It was fun and maybe I will start doing a technical podcast in the
future.  I for one miss [hacker medley][medley]
