**tl;dr** OSUOSL == awesome, I have am organizing [C Conf][cconf] and
will donate part of the revenue to the OSUOSL.

I owe the [Oregon State University Open Source Lab][osuosl] (OSUOSL) a debt for
the boost they gave to my career and I want to pay-it-forward and help other
students succeed. So, I will be [donating][donating] a portion of the procceeds
generated from the [C Conference][cconf] to help someone else succeed. The rest
of the proceeds will be held for future C Conf events.

What is the OSUOSL? It is a unique gem for students and Oregon State.
The alumni of the OSUOSL have gone on to do great things in part due to
the experience and connections they make running systems and writing
code for projects and organizations like Apache, Mozilla and Kernel.org.
I consider myself lucky to be one of the alumni.

**My OSL Story**

The OSL gave me the opportunity to work on production systems and
software while I learned theory in classes. This practical experience
gave me a solid start to be successful outside of school.

After graduation I was hired on by [SUSE Labs][suselabs] via Greg KH, a
well known kernel developer, who visited OSU several times as part of
kernel.org work and the regular lectures he gave at our operating
systems class (I later took over giving [similar][kernel-tutorial]
[lectures][kernel-development] to those classes; it was a lot of fun).

Without the experience I had at the OSUOSL I wouldn't have passed the
SUSE Labs interview exam. Thanks for giving me the leg up! Paying it
forward. Feels good. Hope to see you at [C Conf][cconf]!

**Update:** I will be announcing C Conf's date/time/location on Monday April
30th and open the reverse cfp and registration then.
**Update 2:** [C Conf announced!][cconf]
