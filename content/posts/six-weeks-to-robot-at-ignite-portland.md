<p>Recently I presented at <a href="http://igniteportland.com" title="Ignite Portland" target="_blank">Ignite Portland</a> and a video has been published on <a href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=5_vFMUFzSZI">YouTube</a>.  The event was rockin' and being a part of the whole thing was amazing.  If you weren't able to make it you really missed out.</p>

<p>Luckily, <em>we have the technology</em> to bring the event to you!  <a href="http://www.twitter.com/linuxaid">LinuxAid</a> lovingly recorded all of the talks and  posted them on YouTube.  The complete collection can be found <a href="http://www.igniteportland.com/2008/02/here-come-the-videos/">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to dig in even further <a href="http://www.siliconflorist.com">Silicon Florist</a> has made a <a href="http://siliconflorist.com/2008/02/06/ignite-portland-2-let-the-rounding-up-begin/">links arrangement</a> of the event which includes Flickr links, blog posts and Twitter archives.</p>
