<p>The <a href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org">Linux Plumbers Conference</a>
focuses on a collection 2.5 hour <em>microconferences</em> that gather experts
together to discuss and develop solutions to emerging problems that affect the
Kernel, libraries and supporting system daemons that make Linux Linux. Last
year there were six of these focused microconference on topics including: audio
infrastructure, power management, and boot. </p>

<p>Many of the most successful microconference topics were suggested by
community members not directly involved in planning the conference.</p>

<p><strong>So, I need your help for 2009!</strong></p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/319215/">Call for
Topics</a> and suggest an emerging topic in the Linux plumbing that we should
discuss in 2009. Topics ideas can be submitted in the <a
href="http://lwn.net/Articles/319215/#Comments">comments</a> section of the <a
