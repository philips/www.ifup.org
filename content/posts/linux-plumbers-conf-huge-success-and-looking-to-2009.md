Linux Plumbers Conf was a huge success due to the huge amount of effort put
forth by the <a href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org/organizers/">organizers</a>
and the great turnout of attendees.  Thanks to everyone!

A highlight of the conference, for me, was meeting some of the folks in the
DVB/V4L community.  This was the first time that this many core video
developers were together in the same place and a lot was accomplished.  There
was discussion about the new DVB API for supporting new protocols, libv4l's
progress, routing APIs for future devices, and <a

V4L server</a>. Also, I found out that Mauro now works for Red Hat- which is
great news for the subsystem.

For those who weren't able to make it <a href="http://lwn.net">LWN</a> has a
collection of good wrap-up articles on the front page.  Also, Sri is working on
getting videos of the keynote and some other events up on the web. Keep an eye
on <a href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org">LinuxPlumbersConf.org</a> for those.
