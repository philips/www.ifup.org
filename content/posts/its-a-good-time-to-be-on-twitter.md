<a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a> is a micro-blogging platform resting somewhere in between IRC and e-mail.  It is a nice informal way of staying in touch and people are inclined to use it because of the quick and easy format.

Primarily I use twitter to stay up to date on local <a href="http://pulseofpdx.com">Portland tech</a> but it seems that the Novell and OpenSuSE twitter users are <a href="http://zonker.opensuse.org/2008/02/14/if-twitter-is-your-thing/">growing</a>.

If you want to add me on twitter my account name is <a href="http://twitter.com/philips">philips</a>.
