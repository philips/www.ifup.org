[Nisha](http://inish.org) and I started seriously looking at getting a
house recently. It being the 21st Century means large amounts of our house
hunting time will be spent on the Internet; specifically rmlsweb.com a regional
real estate listing service.

A huge annoyance with the site is that it uses a pretty lame mapping service
called "GeoJet" which generates horrible looking maps.

Naturally, I started Googling for Greasemonkey scripts to find out if someone
had fixed this already and sure enough my friend <a
href="http://www.outflux.net">Kees Cook</a> had <a
href="http://www.outflux.net/blog/archives/2006/04/09/greasemonkey-for-rmls/">written
a user script</a> in 2006! 

With a little modification I got it working great with the new RMLS site. You
can find it at git://ifup.org/philips/rmls-mapper.git or <a
href="http://ifup.org/git/?p=rmls-mapper.git;a=blob_plain;hb=HEAD;f=rmlsweb-mapper.user.js">install
the latest version now</a>!
