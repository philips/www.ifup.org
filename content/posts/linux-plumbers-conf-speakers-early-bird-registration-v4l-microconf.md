<p>The <a href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org">Linux Plumbers Conf</a> early
bird registration is drawing to a close- <a
href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org/register">grab a cheap seat</a> while you
still have time.</p>

<p>Need a bit more convincing? Check out <a
href="http://linuxplumbersconf.org/program/speakers/">our speakers
list</a>.</p>

<p>We released our speaker list this week and we have a great group.  I am most
excited that we are finally bringing together a few of the video4linux
developers for a face to face microconf.</p>

<p>In particular it will be good to talk about libv4l, a low level library that
does frame conversion, since nearly all video applications need conversion soon
to support gspca devices. <a href="http://hansdegoede.livejournal.com/">Hans De
Goede</a> started the library a few months ago and we are both working to <a
href="http://linuxtv.org/v4lwiki/index.php/Libv4l_Progress">patch
applications</a> to get support into OpenSuSE 11.1 and Fedora 10.</p>

<p>Having applications use a library also opens up the possibility of doing
some smart things like launching a proxy server (ala. dmix, pulseaudio) and
having <a href="http://live.gnome.org/Cheese">Cheese</a> and Skype able to use
the camera at the same time. Although, it would be nice if <a
href="https://developer.skype.com/jira/browse/SCL-403">Skype got involved</a>
so we wouldn't have to LDPRELOAD our way in ;)</p>
