Recently I started using OS X for a few personal projects. One of the
most annoying aspects of OS X vs Linux is Window management. GNOME has a
lot of nice shortcuts and a simple powerful virtual desktop system.
Largely these features are missing from OS X. So here are my two tips
for making life more comfortable.

Spaces Tweak
============

By default Spaces warps around to the desktop that has a currently open
window for the application selected with Alt-Tab or a dock click.  This
is annoying if Chrome is selected via alt-tab to open a new window on
the current virtual desktop and instead Spaces warps across three
virtual desktops.  You can fix this by changing the Expose & Spaces
option in the photo below:

ShiftIT
=======

Moving and resizing windows can be a pain with a mouse- particularly if
you are focusing on a task and just need to keep a terminal window
visible. To quickly move windows around in a space check out
[ShiftIT][3].  It is open source and some [new features][4] are on their
way.

With this Spaces tweak and ShiftIT window management is pretty
comfortable on OS X.
