<h3>Getting to the site</h3>
<p>There are two roads that can be taken to the Mt Tabor Amphitheater. The first and shortest route, in red below, is from <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=se+60th+and+salmon+portland&amp;sll=45.512046,-122.595599&amp;sspn=0.01009,0.017123&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=SE+Salmon+St+%26+SE+60th+Ave,+Portland,+Multnomah,+Oregon+97215&amp;ll=45.514076,-122.601929&amp;spn=0.010089,0.017123&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A">SE 60th and Salmon</a>. The second route, in blue below, starts at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=se+60th+and+lincoln+portland&amp;sll=45.514076,-122.601929&amp;sspn=0.010089,0.017123&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=SE+Lincoln+St+%26+SE+60th+Ave,+Portland,+Multnomah,+Oregon+97215&amp;ll=45.508076,-122.601757&amp;spn=0.01009,0.017123&amp;z=16">SE 60th and Lincoln</a> is more scenic and convenient if you are coming from the South. There is parking directly next to the ampitheater

<h3>Parking</h3>
<p>This is a view of the parking lot that is closest to the amphitheater. It is possible that you will not be able to find parking in this lot but there is parking available throughout the park. If you get lost or need help finding the site please <a href="contact/index.html">contact us</a>.

</p>

<h3>Dress Code</h3>
<p>It will most likely be in the high 70s-80s during the wedding and reception so please dress for the heat. This is definitely not a black tie formal event, so please dress nicely but mainly for comfort. Think classy forest picnic. Sundresses for girls, pants and lightweight shirts for boys are great. The front area of the amphitheater where guests will sit for the wedding is packed dirt and the reception will be on the grass. Please wear shoes that will hold up in the grass and dirt - tiny heels are not recommended. 
</p>

<h3>Hotel Information</h3>
<p>A block of hotel rooms is ready for you to call in and reserve at <a href="http://www.ichotelsgroup.com/h/d/sb/1/en/hotel/pdxgw?&amp;cm_mmc=mdpr-_-googlemaps-_-sb-_-pdxgw&amp;externalHotelDetailHit=true">Staybridge Suites - Portland Airport location</a> at: +1-503-262-8888. Please ask the desk attendant for a room under the Philips-George Wedding group rate (this is very important so you get the correct rate). 
</p>
<p>The room rates are as follows for stays within the range from August 1st to August 8th:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     Studio: $69.00
 </li>

 <li>
     One Bedroom with King Bed: $79.00
 </li>

 <li>
     One Bedroom with 2 Double Beds: $89.00
 </li>

 <li>
     Two Bedroom: $ 129.00
 </li>
</ul>
<p>We have an agreement for the hotel to reserve rooms at the rates above, but they don't have a specific number of rooms set aside. They will honor the  lower rates as long as they have rooms available. Therefore it would be best to call in as soon as possible to reserve a room while they are still available.  If you have trouble reserving a room please <a href="contact/index.html">contact us</a>.
</p>

<h3>Enjoying Portland</h3>
<p>Portland has a ton of things to enjoy, particularly in the summer. If you are a fan of food or beer you will find something to enjoy in Portland. In particular I can recommend the following breweries in the SE Portland:
</p>
<ul>
 <li>
     <a href="http://www.luckylab.com/html/story.html">Lucky Lab</a> - good for groups, high ceiling can make it hard to hear though
 </li>

 <li>
     <a href="http://rootsorganicbrewing.com/blog/about">Roots Organic Brewing</a> - Oregon’s First All Organic Brewery, inside picnic tables
 </li>

 <li>
     <a href="http://www.hopworksbeer.com/">HUB</a>  - Restaurant, Pub and Pinball
 </li>

 <li>
     <a href="http://www.horsebrass.com">Horse Brass Pub</a> - Great English Pub, 50+ draught beers, steel-tip darts
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Getting around Portland by bike or public transportation is easy. Throughout the city there are bike corridors, lanes and parking that can make for an enjoyable trip from one side of the city to another. Portland has the Trimet system which includes the MAX light rail, buses and street cars. Here are some resources:
</p>
<ul>

     <a href="http://www.portlandonline.com/transportation/index.cfm?c=34809&amp;">Bike Maps</a>
 </li>

 <li>
     <a href="http://maps.google.com">Google Maps</a> and click Directions -&gt; Bike or Directions -&gt;By Public Transit
 </li>

 <li>
     <a href="http://trimet.org/fares/index.htm">Trimet Fare Table</a> you can buy 2hr passes for $2 or day passes for $4.75 on the bus, MAX stations or at local grocery stores like Fred Meyer and Safeway
 </li>
</ul>
<p>Take a <a href="http://www.portlandwalkingtours.com/">Portland Walking Tour</a> if you want a nice introduction to the city. There are 4 tours offered where you can learn about the city, our old underground system, sample local foods or go ghost hunting. 
</p>
<p>Also Portland has a great food culture. Since the wedding will be happening in the best time of year for weather I recommend enjoying outdoor seating and people watching at one of <a href="http://www.foodcartsportland.com/">PDX's food carts</a>. 
</p>
<p>This weekend will be the <a href="http://www.biteoforegon.com/">Bite of Oregon festival</a> on the waterfront August 6-8. Portland festivals are really fun and its a great way to sample lots of local cuisine and drinks. 
</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/eat-and-drink/find-a-restaurant/">Portland Monthly Magazine Restaurant Finder</a> and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/portland">Yelp</a> are great resources to find fun restaurants in PDX. 
</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.portlandmonthlymag.com/arts-and-entertainment/find-an-event">Portland Monthly Magazine Event Calendar</a> for recommendations on local events ranging from art shows, theater, concerts, dance and special events. 
</p>
<p><a href="http://365thingsportland.com/">365 Things to do in Portland</a> is also an interesting blog to read of one local's quest to try a new thing in PDX every day. It has activities sorted by type. 
</p>
<p>If you're planning on touring outside of Portland, check out <a href="http://www.traveloregon.com/">Travel Oregon</a> where you can plan hiking trips, go see some waterfalls or check out where you can find a u-pick fruit farm in the Gorge.
